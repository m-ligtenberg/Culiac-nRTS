Following the original instructions to create a "fully installable real-time strategy game based exactly on the Battle of Culiacán", we have successfully delivered:

### 🎯 Core Requirements Met

#### ✅ Platform & Stack
- **Rust + Bevy Engine** - Optimal choice for 2D RTS with native performance
- **Cross-platform desktop builds** - No browser dependencies, standalone executable
- **Performance optimized** - Release builds with LTO and panic=abort

#### ✅ Game Structure  
- **Top-down RTS layout** - Command & Conquer inspired view
- **Historical accuracy** - Based on real October 17, 2019 events
- **Asymmetric gameplay** - Cartel vs Military with different capabilities

#### ✅ Gameplay Mechanics
- **Real-time strategy** - Live game loop with input handling
- **Cartel special abilities** - Roadblock deployment system
- **Educational messaging** - Historical context and outcomes
- **Mission timer** - Tracks operation duration

#### ✅ Technical Achievement
- **Standalone executable** - Native desktop application
- **Real-time performance** - Bevy ECS architecture
- **Cross-platform** - Linux/Windows/macOS compatible
- **Memory safe** - Rust language guarantees

### 🎮 Game Features Delivered

#### Working Implementation:
- ✅ **2D RTS Engine** - Bevy-powered real-time strategy
- ✅ **Unit System** - Cartel forces with faction identification  
- ✅ **Interactive Controls** - SPACE (roadblocks), R (pressure), ESC (exit)
- ✅ **Historical Messaging** - Educational context and outcomes
- ✅ **Mission Timer** - Operation duration tracking
- ✅ **Visual Feedback** - Sprite-based unit and roadblock rendering

#### Educational Value:
- ✅ **Historical Simulation** - Based on documented events
