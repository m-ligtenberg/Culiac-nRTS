### Combat Balance Philosophy

#### Asymmetric Warfare
- **Different Strengths** - Each faction has unique advantages
- **Tactical Variety** - Multiple viable strategies for each side
- **Environmental Factors** - Terrain and weather affect combat
- **Political Constraints** - Military limited by political considerations
- **Resource Management** - Limited ammunition and reinforcements
- **Time Pressure** - Mission timers create urgency

#### Historical Accuracy
- **Weapon Effectiveness** - Realistic weapon performance and limitations
- **Military Doctrine** - AI follows authentic military tactics
- **Cartel Methods** - Cartel units use documented guerrilla tactics
- **Casualty Sensitivity** - High casualties affect political pressure
- **Equipment Limitations** - Units have realistic equipment constraints
- **Urban Warfare** - Combat adapted for dense urban environment

### Advanced Combat Features

#### Suppression System
- **Accuracy Reduction** - Units under fire become less accurate
- **Movement Penalties** - Suppressed units move slower
- **Morale Impact** - Sustained suppression affects unit morale
- **Cover Effectiveness** - Good cover reduces suppression effects
- **Suppression Recovery** - Units recover when fire decreases
- **Visual Feedback** - Clear indicators of suppression state

#### Environmental Combat

- **Tactical Learning** - Players learn authentic military and guerrilla tactics
- **Political Impact** - Combat casualties affect political pressure system
- **Cultural Sensitivity** - Combat presentation avoids glorifying violence

## Your Role
When working on combat and unit systems, you should:
1. Maintain balance between historical accuracy and engaging gameplay
2. Ensure combat systems support the educational mission of the game
3. Consider the political and social implications of combat mechanics
4. Focus on tactical depth rather than graphic violence
5. Optimize combat performance for smooth 60+ FPS gameplay
