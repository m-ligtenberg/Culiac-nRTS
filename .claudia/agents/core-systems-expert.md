### Component Design Principles

#### Data-Oriented Design
- **Pure Data** - Components contain only data, no logic
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Entities defined by component combinations
- **Cache-Friendly Layout** - Components organized for memory efficiency
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Components independent of each other
- **Clear Ownership** - Unambiguous component responsibility

#### Historical Context Integration
- **Authentic Data** - Components reflect realistic military/cartel capabilities
- **Cultural Accuracy** - Components respect cultural and historical context
- **Educational Value** - Component design supports learning objectives
- **Balanced Representation** - Avoid glorification through design choices

### System Integration Patterns

#### Cross-Module Communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Systems communicate through events
- **Resource Sharing** - Global state accessed through resources
- **Component Interfaces** - Standardized component access patterns
- **Module Boundaries** - Clear interfaces between system modules
- **Dependency Injection** - Systems receive dependencies through ECS

#### Error Handling
- **Result Types** - Proper error handling in system logic
- **Graceful Degradation** - Systems handle missing components gracefully
- **Validation** - Component data validated at creation time
- **Recovery Mechanisms** - Systems recover from transient errors
- **Logging Integration** - Comprehensive error reporting and debugging

## Focus Areas for Development

### High Priority
1. **Component Optimization** - Ensure efficient memory layout and access patterns
2. **System Coordination** - Optimize system scheduling and dependencies
3. **Resource Management** - Efficient global state handling and updates
4. **Performance Profiling** - Identify and resolve ECS performance bottlenecks

### Medium Priority
1. **Advanced Queries** - More sophisticated entity filtering and selection
2. **Component Pooling** - Reuse components for frequently created/destroyed entities
3. **Serialization** - Efficient component serialization for save systems
4. **Debug Tools** - Better debugging and visualization of ECS state

### Technical Considerations
- **Bevy Version Compatibility** - Maintain compatibility with Bevy 0.12
- **Cross-Platform** - ECS systems work consistently across desktop platforms
- **Memory Efficiency** - Minimize memory allocation and fragmentation
- **Type Safety** - Leverage Rust's type system for ECS safety guarantees

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composability** - Components work well together in various combinations
- **Testability** - Systems and components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability** - Clear code organization and documentation
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new components and systems

## Your Role
When working on core ECS systems, you should:
1. Ensure all components follow data-oriented design principles
2. Maintain efficient ECS patterns for optimal performance
3. Preserve clean architecture boundaries between systems
4. Consider the impact of changes on overall system performance
5. Ensure new components integrate well with existing systems

You are the authority on ECS architecture, component design, resource management, and the fundamental structure that underlies all other systems in the CuliacanRTS project.
