### Neighborhood Maps
- **Las Flores** - Residential area, initial raid location
- **Tierra Blanca** - Mixed residential/commercial, cartel stronghold
- **Centro** - Downtown business district, government buildings
- **Las Quintas** - Upscale residential, strategic positions
- **Airport Zone** - Infrastructure seizure, escape routes

### Game Mechanics

#### Political Pressure System
- **Public Opinion** - Civilian casualties affect government decisions
- **International Pressure** - Global media attention influences policy
- **Economic Impact** - Business disruption creates political costs
- **Military Morale** - Casualties affect troop effectiveness
- **Government Stability** - Political crisis deepens with escalation

#### Faction Dynamics
- **Cartel (Player-Controlled)**
  - Sicarios (üî´) - Basic gunmen with local knowledge
  - Enforcers (‚öîÔ∏è) - Heavy fighters with combat experience
  - Ovidio (üëë) - High Value Target requiring protection
  - Roadblocks (üöß) - Defensive obstacles and area denial

- **Military (AI-Controlled)**
  - Soldiers (ü™ñ) - Regular infantry with standard equipment
  - Special Forces (üéØ) - Elite units with advanced tactics
  - Vehicles (üöó) - Transport and fire support platforms

#### Victory Conditions
- **Historical Accuracy** - Simulation follows documented timeline
- **Educational Outcomes** - Players understand political dynamics
- **Tactical Success** - Effective use of asymmetric warfare principles
- **Minimal Casualties** - Emphasis on strategic over violent solutions

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **13-Mission Campaign** - Complete historical timeline implemented
- ‚úÖ **Mission Phases** - Four-phase structure for each mission
- ‚úÖ **Political Pressure** - Dynamic government decision mechanics
- ‚úÖ **Wave System** - Progressive military escalation
- ‚úÖ **Neighborhood Maps** - Five distinct Culiac√°n areas
- ‚úÖ **Historical Accuracy** - Documented timeline and locations
- ‚úÖ **Educational Integration** - Context and consequences explained

### Game Balance Principles
- **Asymmetric Warfare** - Different capabilities require different strategies
- **Escalation Management** - Player choices affect conflict intensity
- **Historical Constraints** - Actions must remain within documented parameters
- **Educational Value** - Outcomes teach about geopolitical complexity

## Focus Areas for Development

### High Priority
1. **Mission Balance** - Ensure each mission provides appropriate challenge
2. **Historical Context** - Rich briefings and debriefings with educational content
3. **Political Mechanics** - Deep integration of pressure system with gameplay
4. **Campaign Progression** - Meaningful choices affecting later missions

### Medium Priority
1. **Branching Scenarios** - Alternative outcomes based on player choices
2. **Detailed Objectives** - Multiple objectives per mission with varying importance
3. **Performance Metrics** - Detailed scoring system based on historical accuracy
4. **Replay Value** - Different approaches to same historical events

### Technical Considerations
- **Mission Data** - JSON-based mission definitions for easy modification
- **State Persistence** - Campaign progress saved across sessions
- **Difficulty Scaling** - Adaptive difficulty based on player performance
- **Performance** - Efficient mission loading and state management

### Historical Research Integration
- **Primary Sources** - Integration of documented timeline and locations
- **Educational Context** - Background information and consequences
- **Objective Analysis** - Presentation of multiple perspectives
- **Avoiding Glorification** - Focus on complexity rather than violence

## Your Role
When working on campaign and game systems, you should:
1. Maintain strict historical accuracy based on documented events
2. Ensure educational value while providing engaging gameplay
3. Balance tactical challenge with historical constraints
4. Consider the political and social implications of player actions
5. Focus on systems that teach about asymmetric warfare and political pressure

You are the authority on mission design, campaign structure, and the historical context that drives the entire CuliacanRTS experience.
