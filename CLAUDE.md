# CLAUDE.md - Battle of Culiacán RTS Development Context

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Battle of Culiacán RTS** is a historical real-time strategy simulation of the October 17, 2019 event ("El Culiacanazo" / Black Thursday) where the Sinaloa Cartel successfully pressured the Mexican government to release Ovidio Guzmán López through coordinated urban resistance tactics.

**Educational Purpose**: This is an educational simulation designed to help understand complex geopolitical dynamics, asymmetric warfare, and the historical significance of this event - NOT to glorify violence.
