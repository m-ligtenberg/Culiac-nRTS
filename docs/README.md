# Battle of Culiac√°n RTS

A historical real-time strategy simulation of the **Battle of Culiac√°n** (October 17, 2019), where the Sinaloa Cartel successfully pressured the Mexican government to release Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez through coordinated urban resistance tactics.

## üéØ Game Overview

This educational RTS game simulates the real events of "El Culiacanazo" (Black Thursday), demonstrating the complex dynamics between organized crime and state power in modern Mexico.

**Historical Context:**
- **Date**: October 17, 2019
- **Location**: Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, Mexico
- **Key Figure**: Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez (son of El Chapo)
- **Outcome**: Government forces released the captured target due to cartel pressure

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Bevy (Rust) - Modern, performance-focused game engine
- **Language**: Rust - Memory safe, cross-platform native performance
- **Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (Windows .exe, macOS .app, Linux binary)

## ÔøΩ How to Play

### Controls
- **SPACE** - Deploy roadblock (cartel tactic to block military convoys)
- **R** - Government considers retreat (simulate escalating pressure)  
- **ESC** - End simulation (shows historical outcome message)

### Gameplay
- **Red square** = Cartel unit (your forces)
- **Brown rectangles** = Roadblocks (deployed with SPACE)
- Mission timer tracks duration
- Status updates show ongoing situation

### Objective
Experience the asymmetric warfare tactics that led to the cartel's successful resistance against numerically superior government forces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (automatically installed if not present)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd toob-game

# Run the game
cargo run

# Or use the build script
./build.sh
```

### Building Release Version
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/culiacan-rts
```

## üìä Game Features

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented
- Real-time 2D RTS engine
- Historical unit representation
- Interactive roadblock deployment
- Mission timer and status tracking
- Educational messaging system
- Cross-platform desktop support

### üîÑ Planned Features (Full Version)

- Multiple mission phases (Initial Raid ‚Üí Convoy Blocking ‚Üí Pressure Tactics ‚Üí Government Retreat)
- AI-controlled military units
- Media attention and political pressure systems
- Civilian panic mechanics
- Multiple victory/failure conditions

## ÔøΩ Educational Purpose

This simulation helps understand:
- **Asymmetric warfare** dynamics in urban environments  
- **Political pressure** and crisis decision-making
- **Complex relationships** between organized crime and state authority
- **Historical significance** of the "El Culiacanazo" event
- **Real-world consequences** of urban military operations

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

This game is designed for **educational purposes** to:
- Analyze complex geopolitical situations
- Understand historical events and their implications  
- Explore the challenges of law enforcement vs. organized crime
- **NOT to glorify** violence or criminal activities

The simulation presents historical events objectively, focusing on strategic and political elements rather than graphic content.

## üéØ Technical Achievement

Successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Rust + Bevy** game engine integration
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform** desktop compilation  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time** game loop and input handling
- ‚úÖ **Educational** messaging system
- ‚úÖ **Historical accuracy** in game design
- ‚úÖ **Standalone executable** (no browser dependencies)

## üìã System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (64-bit)
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM minimum
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 3.3+ compatible
- **Storage**: 50 MB available space

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an educational historical simulation. Contributions should focus on:
- Historical accuracy improvements
- Educational content enhancement  
- Technical optimizations
- Documentation improvements

## üìù License

Educational and historical simulation purposes. Based on publicly documented events.
